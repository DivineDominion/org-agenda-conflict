* Introduction

~org-agenda-conflict~ allows to mark conflicting items in the org
agenda. Conflicting items are items with an overlap between their
start and end date.  The marking assumed that items are sorted and
only checks for conflicts between two consecutive lines. It can
probably be extended to check for conflicts between all items but this
would slow down marking.

** Example Usage

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

(add-hook 'org-agenda-finalize-hook
          '(lambda () (org-agenda-conflict-mark 'error)))

#+end_src
